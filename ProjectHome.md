Browserscope is an open-source project for profiling web browsers and storing and aggregating crowd-sourced data about browser performance.

The goals are to foster innovation by tracking browser functionality and to be a resource for web developers.

## The Advantages of Crowdsourcing ##
The data on browserscope is submitted by users who opt-in to share their test results.
  * The ability for users to contribute results is the key for Browserscope's longevity, accuracy, and currency.
  * No dedicated test resources are required; enabling the project to run in perpetuity
  * Tests are run under a wide variety of real world test conditions
  * Aggregating results reduces selection bias
  * New browsers show up immediately due to developer testing
